if {chimp_test_score} == 5:
	That's great work from Sam. Exactly how chimps should be performing in these tests.
elif {chimp_test_score} == 4:
	Sam appears to be performing below average today.
	Not bad for a human, but underwhelming for a chimp.
elif {chimp_test_score} == 3:
	Perhaps Sam hasn't had enough bananas today, because that didn't go well at all.
elif {chimp_test_score} == 2:
	How disappointing, even humans usually manage to beat that level easily.
elif {chimp_test_score} == 1:
	Maybe he closed his eyes on that attempt...
if {chimp_test_score} == 0:
	I guess Sam didn't realise he had to click the boxes in numerical order...
In any case, that was some good data for us to use.
Next, we're simply going to show Sam an image of a banana. Let's see how he reacts to it.
