if {chimp_test_score} == 5:
	Great work ___. Of course that's pretty standard for chimps, as they usually perform a lot better than humans in that last test.
elif {chimp_test_score} == 4:
	___ appears to be performing below average today.
	Not bad for a human, but underwhelming for a chimp.
elif {chimp_test_score} == 3:
	Perhaps ___ hasn't had enough bananas today, because that didn't go well at all.
elif {chimp_test_score} == 2:
	How disappointing, even humans usually manage to beat that level easily.
elif {chimp_test_score} == 1:
	Maybe he closed his eyes on that attempt...
if {chimp_test_score} == 0:
	I guess ___ didn't realise he had to click the boxes in numerical order...
In any case, that was some good data for us to use.
Next, we're simply going to show __ an image of a banana. Let's see how he reacts to it.
