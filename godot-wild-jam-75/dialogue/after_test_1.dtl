Hmm, interesting...
Anyway...
Everyone, meet ___. He's our subject for today.
We're going to put him through a series of tests to demonstrate his level of intelligence.
Of course, he is a chimp, so there are some tests he may not pass, even if they seem simple to us humans.
For example, we just gave him a Rorschach test - or inkblot test.
Of course, there's nothing to glean from his results. We simply think he enjoys looking at pictures and pressing random buttons.
But now that he's warmed up, let's give him a real test
