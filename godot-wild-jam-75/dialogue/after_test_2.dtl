Very interesting.
if {prog_matrices_score} == 4:
	That's incredibly impressive for a chimp. A perfect score!
elif {prog_matrices_score} == 3:
	Not bad for a chimp, 3/4 answers. This suggests that ___ has a relatively high IQ, for a chimp!
elif {prog_matrices_score} == 2:
	That's more or less what I expected, 2/4 answers correct. That equates to an IQ similar to a human 3 year old.
elif :
	I must admit, I'm a little disppointed to see only 1 correct answer in that last test.
else:
	Not a single question right in that last test...
	Perhaps he was getting them wrong on purpose?
Up next, we have test 3\: The Chimp Test
